                Hi there!
                I'm Angela, and I am currently enrolled in level 3 of a 5-year Software Engineering and Management co-op program.
                I am super passionate about all things related to technology and business.
                I have a vested interest in programming as well as marketing, and I encourage you to look at my recent
                projects!
            </p>

            <p>
            I have Business management, leadership, communications, and customer relations skills from previous work experience.
            I developed excellent teamwork, communication, and time management skills from business courses.
            </p>
